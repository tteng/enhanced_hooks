= enhanced_hooks
With enhanced hooks, you can keep an eye on any action on your rails controller, say in your sns website, when user posts a blog, you need to notice all of his friends, but it's really urgly to do like this:

  BlogController:
    def create
      # new and save code
      notice_all_friends
    end
  end

let's take another scenario, in your sns site, when one user makes friends with the other one, we should notice all friends of these two people, but how to?
we'd beeter have an observer on the action, the code in the make_friends action block only concerns about building relationship between the two people, the observer then notice other people on fly.  

Usage:

in your Gemfile:

    gem "enhanced_hooks", :version => ">=0.4.1"

and the generate command :

  ~your_project_path> rails g enhanced_hooks create_favorite Favorites create 

here 'create_event' stands for the event name, and 'Favorites' 'create' for which contorller#action to observe

then it will generate a event file named create_favorite_event.rb under the Rails.root/events directory,  which content like following:


  for_action FavoritesController, :create do

    before do
      # This will be called before FavoriteController#create
    end

    after do
      # This will be called after FavoriteController#create
    end

  end


now you can add your code in the block and after block, enjoy.

= to observe multiple actions 

to observe multiple actions, you should:

  for_actions [[FavoritesController, :create], [BlogsController,:create]] do

    before do
      # your code goes here
    end

    after do
      # your code goes here
    end

  end
